The LINE Client Protocol of Star Neptune BOT

## What Is It

This is the API of LINE to connect their Talk Service

## Why We Upload It

Due to [Star Neptune BOT](https://snb.starinc.xyz) project has been delayed for 5 years, so we put it to GitHub as an opensource project.

## Requirement

Recommand Environment:

    Go Language Compiler >= 1.9

If you have the other "LINE Unofficial API Core for Go Language", you can replace [olsb_cores](https://github.com/star-inc/NepCoreO/blob/master/NepCoreO.go#L20) with it.

## Installation

Type:

    go get github.com/star-inc/thrift_go/thrift
    go get github.com/star-inc/NepCoreO

If you want to use *olsb_cores*, type:

    go get github.com/star-inc/olsb_cores/libs/NepCoreO

## How To Use

Modify the [config.json](config.json) for connection.

You can replace *olsb_cores* with the CORE what you own in [NepCoreO.go](NepCoreO.go)

And...

> Start your project !
